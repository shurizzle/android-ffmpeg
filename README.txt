This is a new android-ffmpeg project since it seems there were so many
different ways of doing it, it was confusing.  So here is my clean, easily
changeable, static ffmpeg creator for Android.  The result is a single
'ffmpeg' that is statically linked, so its the only file you need.

setup
-----

 1. Install the Android NDK
 2. On Debian/Ubuntu, run: apt-get install yasm bash patch make


building
--------

cd android-ffmpeg
./setup.sh
NDK_BASE=/path/to/android-ndk ./configure_make_everything.sh

That should give you command line binary ffmpeg/ffmpeg, which is the only file
you should need.


customizing
-----------

If you want to change which coders, decoders, muxers, filters, etc that are
included, edit configure_ffmpeg.sh and add/substract what you want.
